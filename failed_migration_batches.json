        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Lorenz curve shows the proportion of income earned by any given percentage of the population. The Lorenz curve is a way of showing the distribution of income (or wealth) within an economy. It was developed by Max O. Lorenz in 1905 for representing wealth distribution. If there was perfect equality – if everyone had the same salary – the poorest 20% of the population would gain 20% of the total income. The poorest 60% of the population would get 60% of the income.\nStatement 2 is correct: The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, measures income distribution across a population. Developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, it often serves as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income distribution or, less commonly, wealth distribution among a population. The coefficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality.

The approach argues for higher government expenditure on education, health, social secondary and amenities. People are not participants in development but only passive recipients. The government is responsible for increasing levels of human development by maximising expenditure on welfare.\nOption (d) is not correct: Basic Needs Approach: This approach was initially proposed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

India witnessed a combined (Central and State governments) fiscal deficit of more than 12% of GDP.\nStatement 3 is not correct: A sharp rise in crude prices, triggered by the oil shock of 199091, meant India was suddenly paying more for fuel while its exports to the region slowed to a trickle. India’s forex reserves started depleting at a fast clip as it was suddenly forced to pay much more for its imports. By June 1991, India had less than $1 billion foreign reserves, just about enough dollars to meet about three weeks of imports, even after substantial borrowing from the IMF earlier in the year.\nTherefore option (a) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "Paradox of thrift was popularized by the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes. It states that individuals try to save more during an economic recession, which essentially leads to a fall in aggregate demand and hence in economic growth.

Salve saw its recommendation period extended to six years from the conventional five.\nStatement 2 is not correct: The share of states in the central taxes for the 2021-26 period is recommended to be 41%, same as that for 2020-21. This is less than the 42% share recommended by the 14th Finance Commission for 2015-20 period. The adjustment of 1% is to provide for the newly formed union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh from the resources of the center. \nStatement 3 is not correct: The Terms of Reference of the Commission required it to use the population data of 2011 while making recommendations. The demographic performance criterion has been used to reward efforts made by states in controlling their population. States with a lower fertility ratio will be scored higher on this criterion. \nTherefore the correct answer is option B.",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Tax mitigation is when a taxpayer uses a fiscal incentive (tax concession) available to him in the tax legislation so that he need not pay tax. The taxpayer takes advantage of a fiscal incentive in the form of a tax concession.\nA large number of tax reduction measures are available for income tax payers – both corporate and personal income tax payers. Some tax reduction measures like tax mitigation, tax planning and tax avoidance are legally permissible. On the other hand, tax evasion is illegal.                                                                                                                         Tax avoidance tends to involve the use of specific loopholes in the law, such as tax havens or tax shelters to help reduce your tax bill. As a result tax avoidance is likely to be viewed much more negatively, given its association to exploit the tax system for personal gain.\nHence both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are correct.

        "explanation": "Sometimes, the government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy stance and increases its spending to boost economic activity. This leads to an increase in interest rates. Increased interest rates affect private investment decisions. A high magnitude of the crowding out effect may even lead to lesser income in the economy.\nWith higher interest rates, the cost for funds to be invested increases and affects their accessibility to debt financing mechanisms. This leads to lesser investment ultimately and crowds out the impact of the initial rise in the total investment spending. Usually the initial increase in government spending is funded using higher taxes or borrowing on part of the government.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

If the bank rate is increased, the commercial banks will borrow less funds and give less loans. This will increase the interest rates as well. And in general, the supply of money in the market will actually decrease.\nOption 3 is correct: Repo rate refers to the rate at which commercial banks borrow money by selling their securities to the Central Bank of our country i.e. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to maintain liquidity. A decline in the repo rate can lead to the banks bringing down their lending rate thus increasing money supply. \nOption 4 is correct: As SLR is decreased banks will have to keep less liquidity with themselves.

The Indian agricultural sector has developed at a slow pace and still faces many major issues like:\n• Agriculture in India largely depends on the monsoon. As a result, production of food-grains fluctuates year after year. So, excessive dependence on monsoon rains is a major hurdle.\n• Cropping Pattern of food and non-food crops.\n• There is still some degree of concentration of land holding. It is believed by experts that a large portion of farm-land in India is owned by a relatively small section of the rich farmers, landlords and money-lenders, while the vast majority of farmers own very little amount of land, or no land at all.\n• To get more output from small landholdings or for better productivity, farmers heavily rely on chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides which degrade the land.\n• Other issues include systems and techniques of farming, use of poor quality seeds, inadequate water supply etc.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "All the statements are correct:\n1. Orthodox rule of Aurangzeb – The Deccan policies and religion of Aurangzeb played a part in the fall of the empire. The Mughal government was pushed to its limits in an attempt to extend its rule over Golconda, Bijapur, and Karnataka. \n2. Foreign invasions – The imperial treasury suffered greatly as a result of the foreign invasions led by Ahmad Shah Abdali and Nadir Shah. \n3. Marathas played a major role in the decline of Mughal power-The decline of the Mughal authority was largely attributed to the Marathas. The Maratha War of Independence took place between the Maratha and Mughal empires between 1680 and 1707. The Deccan Wars began in 1680 when Aurangzeb, the Mughal emperor, invaded the Maratha enclave that Chatrapati Shivaji had founded in Bijapur.\n4. Due to their weakness, Aurangzeb's successors fell prey to the machinations and deceit of the divided nobility. They were incompetent generals who could not put down uprisings. \nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The RIN revolt started on 18 February 1946 in Bombay. The naval ratings on HMIS Talwar protested against the poor quality of food and racial discrimination by British officers. The protest spread rapidly to the Castle and Fort barracks on shore, and to 22 ships in Bombay harbour. By the following evening, a naval central strike committee was elected. The mutineers took out a procession in Bombay, holding aloft a portrait of Subhas Chandra Bose. Their ships also raised the flags of the Congress, Muslim League and Communist Party.\nStatements 1,2 and 3 are correct: The demands advanced by the naval central strike committee combined service grievances with wider national concerns. The latter included the release of INA (Indian National Army) personnel and other political prisoners, withdrawal of Indian troops from Indonesia and the acceptance of Indian officers only as superiors.\nStatement 4 is not correct: It was not a demand of the Naval Central Strike Committee.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

Under Sher Shah, land was divided into three categories- good, bad and middle, and the average yield of each was computed. One-third of the average yield was the share of the state. On this basis, a crop-rate (ray) was drawn up, so that as soon as the sown field was measured, the share of the state could be determined. This could then be converted into rupees on the basis of local rates. The peasants were given the option of paying in cash or in kind, though Sher Shah preferred cash.\nStatement 2 is correct: Land revenue was the chief source of revenue in Vijayanagar Kingdom.

        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Agriculture was organised around two major seasonal cycles, the kharif (autumn) and the rabi (spring). This would mean that most regions, except those terrains that were the most arid or inhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a year (do-fasla), whereas some, where rainfall or irrigation assured a continuous supply of water, even gave three crops. This ensured an enormous variety of produce. \nStatement 2 is correct: Panchayats had the authority to levy fines and inflict more serious forms of punishment like expulsion from the community. The latter was a drastic step and was in most cases meted out for a limited period. It meant that a person forced to leave the village became an outcaste and lost his right to practise his profession. Such a measure was intended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.\nStatement 3 is correct: Peshkash was a form of tribute collected by the Mughal state. External forces entered the forest in different ways. For instance, the state required elephants for the army. So the peshkash levied from forest people often included a supply of elephants.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

According to the variations in relief features, the Northern plains can be divided into four regions. \nBhabar: The rivers, after descending from the mountains, deposit pebbles in a narrow belt of about 8 to 16 km in width lying parallel to the slopes of the Shiwaliks. It is known as bhabar. All the streams disappear in this bhabar belt. \nTarai: South of bhabar belt, the streams and rivers re-emerge and create a wet, swampy and marshy region known as terai. \nBhangar: The largest part of the northern plain is formed of older alluvium. It lies above the floodplains of the rivers and presents a terrace- like feature. This part is known as bhangar. The soil in this region contains calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar.\nKhadar: The newer, younger deposits of the floodplains are called khadar.

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Statements 1 and 2 are correct: The changes in the upper air circulation over Indian landmass is yet another cause for the sudden outbreak of monsoons in India. Jet streams in the upper air system influence the climate of India in the following ways:\nWesterly Jet stream and its Impact: During Winter, at about 8 km above sea level, a westerly jet stream blows at a very high speed over the sub- tropical zone. This jet stream is bifurcated by the Himalayan ranges. The northern branch of this jet stream blows along the northern edge of this barrier. The southern branch blows eastwards south of the Himalayan ranges along 25° N latitude. It is believed by meteorologists that this branch of jet stream exercises a significant influence on the winter weather conditions over India. This jet stream is responsible for bringing western disturbances from the Mediterranean region into the Indian subcontinent. Winter rain and hail storms in north-western plains and occasional heavy snowfall in hilly regions are caused by these disturbances. These are generally followed by cold waves in the whole of northern plains.\nEasterly Jet and its Influence: During summer, due to the apparent shift of the sun in the northern hemisphere, the reversal in upper air circulation takes place. The westerly stream is replaced by the easterly jet stream which owes its origin to the heating of the Tibetan plateau. This leads to the development of an easterly cold jet stream centered around 15°N latitude and blowing over peninsular India. This helps in the sudden onset of monsoons.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "The Green Revolution was a government programme for modernisation of agriculture launched in the 1960s. It was largely funded by international agencies that was based on providing high-yielding variety(HYV) or hybrid seeds along with pesticides, fertilisers, and other inputs, to farmers. Green Revolution programmes were introduced only in areas that had assured irrigation, because sufficient water was necessary for the new seeds and methods of cultivation. \nStatement 1 is correct: It led to cropping pattern distortions and monoculture practices. Mostly the focus was on cultivation of Wheat over other crops. \nStatement 2 is not correct: It increased the regional disparity among farmers. The farmers of Punja, Western Uttar Pradesh gained much from the Green revolution but the farmers of Eastern India could not benefit much.\nTherefore option (a) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Coral and algae depend on each other to survive. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live in their tissues. These algae are the coral’s primary food source and give them their colour. If stressed, algae leaves the coral. When the symbiotic relationship becomes stressed due to increased ocean temperature or pollution, the algae leave the coral's tissue.\nStatement 2 is correct: Increased ocean temperature caused by climate change is the leading cause of coral bleaching. Runoff and pollution Storm generated precipitation can rapidly dilute ocean water and runoff can carry pollutants, these can bleach near-shore corals. Overexposure to sunlight, when temperatures are high, high solar irradiance contributes to bleaching in shallow-water corals.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "The factors which affect the distribution of temperature of ocean water are :\n(i) Latitude: the temperature of surface water decreases from the equator towards the poles because the amount of insolation decreases poleward.\n(ii) Unequal distribution of land and water : the oceans in the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact with larger extent of land than the oceans in the southern hemisphere.\n(iii) Prevailing wind: the winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results in the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.\n(iv) Ocean currents : warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while the cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. Gulf stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the north-east coast of North America.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a regular volume of water in a definite path and direction. Ocean currents are influenced by two types of forces namely : (i) primary forces that initiate the movement of water; (ii) secondary forces that influence the currents to flow.\nThe primary forces that influence the currents are: (i) heating by solar energy; (ii) wind; (iii) gravity; (iv) coriolis force. Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. These large accumulations of water and the flow around them are called Gyres. These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Mumbai experiences a heavy downpour for a short duration in the day, although it’s not yet the onset of monsoon on account of Convectional Rain: The air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulus clouds are formed. With thunder and lightning, heavy rainfall takes place but this does not last long. Such rain is common in the summer or in the hotter part of the day.

Therefore, the places near the sea-level record higher temperature than the places situated at higher elevations. In other words, the temperature generally decreases with increasing height. \nDistance from the sea : Compared to land, the sea gets heated slowly and loses heat slowly. Land heats up and cools down quickly. Therefore, the variation in temperature over the sea is less compared to land. The places situated near the sea come under the moderating influence of the sea and land breezes which moderate the temperature.\nAir-mass and Ocean currents : Like the land and sea breezes, the passage of air masses also affects the temperature. The places, which come under the influence of warm air- masses experience higher temperature and the places that come under the influence of cold air-masses experience low temperature.

Over time, the pull of gravity from our solar system’s two largest gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, causes the shape of Earth’s orbit to vary from nearly circular to slightly elliptical. Eccentricity measures how much the shape of Earth’s orbit departs from a perfect circle. These variations affect the distance between Earth and the Sun.\nStatement 2 is correct: Eccentricity is the reason that causes our seasons to be slightly different lengths, with summers in the Northern Hemisphere currently about 4.5 days longer than winters and springs about three days longer than autumns. As eccentricity decreases, the length of our seasons gradually evens out.\nStatement 3 is not correct: The total change in global annual insolation due to the eccentricity cycle is very small. Because variations in Earth’s eccentricity are fairly small, they’re a relatively minor factor in annual seasonal climate variations.\nTherefore option (a) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "In the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court laid down a new doctrine of the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. It ruled that the constituent power of Parliament under Article 368 does not enable it to alter the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. This means that the Parliament cannot abridge or take away a Fundamental Right that forms a part of the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution.\nHowever, the Supreme Court is yet to define or clarify as to what constitutes the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. From the various judgements, the following have emerged as ‘basic features’ of the Constitution or elements of the ‘basic structure’ of the constitution:\n1) Supremacy of the Constitution\n2) Sovereign, democratic and republican nature of the Indian polity\n3) Secular character of the Constitution\n4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary\n5) Federal character of the Constitution\n6) Unity and integrity of the nation\n7) Welfare state (socio-economic justice)\n8) Judicial review\n9) Freedom and dignity of the individual\n10)Parliamentary system\n11) Rule of law\n12) Harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles\n13) Principle of equality\n14)Free and fair elections\n15) Independence of Judiciary\n16) Limited power of Parliament to amend the Constitution (not sovereignty of the Parliament)\n17) Effective access to justice 18. Principles (or essence) underlying fundamental rights\n18) Powers of the Supreme Court under Articles 32, 136, 141 and 142\n19) Powers of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227.\nTherefore option c is the correct answer.

        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Articles 12-35 of Indian Constitution deal with Fundamental Rights. These rights are conferred upon the citizens of India for the Constitution tells that these rights are inviolable. Right to Life, Right to Dignity, and Right to Education etc. all come under one of the six main fundamental rights. These are negative as they prohibit the State from doing certain things and articles 36-51 under Part-IV of the Indian Constitution deal with Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). They are borrowed from the Constitution of Ireland. These are positive as they require the State to do certain things.\nStatement 2 is correct: Fundamental rights promote the welfare of the individual. Hence, they are personal and individualistic. And directive principles of state policy promote the welfare of the community. Hence, they are societarian and socialistic.\nStatement 3 is correct: Fundamental rights have legal sanctions hence they do not require any legislation for their implementation. They are automatically enforced and directive principles have moral and Political sanctions. They require legislation for their implementation. They are not automatically enforced.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "Statements 2 and 4 are correct: Article 1 describes India, that is, Bharat as a ‘Union of States’ rather than a ‘Federation of States’. This provision deals with two things: one, name of the country; and two, type of polity.\n1) Name of Country: There was no unanimity in the Constituent Assembly with regard to the name of the country. Some members suggested the traditional name (Bharat), while others advocated the modern name (India). Hence, the Constituent Assembly had to adopt a mix of both (‘India, that is, Bharat’). \n2) Type of Polity: India is described as ‘Union’ although its Constitution is federal in structure. According to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the phrase ‘Union of States’ has been preferred to ‘Federation of States’. The federation is a Union because it is indestructible. The country is an integral whole and divided into different states only for the convenience of administration. Statement 1 and 3 are incorrect: Article 2 deals with the provisions regarding establishment of new states. It empowers the Parliament to ‘admit into the Union of India, or establish, new states on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit’. Article 12 describes the definition of State; including the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\nTherefore option (b) is correct answer.",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: The term of the Prime Minister is not fixed and he holds office during the pleasure of the president. However, this does not mean that the president can dismiss the Prime Minister at any time. So long as the Prime Minister enjoys the majority support in the Lok Sabha, he cannot be dismissed by the President. However, if he loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha, he must resign or the President can dismiss him.\nStatement 2 is incorrect: The Election Commission shall consist of the chief election commissioner and such number of other election commissioners, if any, as the president may from time to time fix. Any other election commissioner or a regional commissioner cannot be removed from office except on the recommendation of the chief election commissioner. The chief election commissioner is provided with the security of tenure. He cannot be removed from his office except in the same manner and on the same grounds as a judge of the Supreme Court. Thus, he does not hold his office till the pleasure of the president, though he is appointed by him.\nStatement 3 is correct: The Attorney General (AG) is appointed by the president. He must be a person who is qualified to be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. The term of office of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution. Further, the Constitution does not contain the procedure and grounds for his removal. He holds office during the pleasure of the president. This means that he may be removed by the president at any time. He may also quit his office by submitting his resignation to the president. Conventionally, he resigns when the government (council of ministers) resigns or is replaced, as he is appointed on its advice.\nStatement 4 is incorrect: The CAG is appointed by the president of India by a warrant under his hand and seal.He holds office for a period of six years or up to the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier. He can resign anytime from his office by addressing the resignation letter to the president. He can also be removed by the president on the same grounds and in the same manner as a judge of the Supreme Court. Thus, he does not hold his office till the pleasure of the president, though he is appointed by him.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

        "explanation": "Uranium enrichment is the process of increasing the percentage of Uranium-235 from 0.7 percent in natural uranium to about 3 to 5 percent for use in fuel for nuclear reactors.\nThe nuclear fuel used in a nuclear reactor needs to have a higher concentration of the U235 isotope than that which exists in natural uranium ore. U235 when concentrated (or \"enriched\") is fissionable in light-water reactors. During fission, the nucleus of the atom splits apart producing both heat and extra neutrons. Under controlled conditions, these extra neutrons can cause additional, nearby atoms to fission and a nuclear reaction can be sustained. The heat energy released, by the controlled nuclear reaction within the nuclear reactor, can be harnessed to produce electricity. Commercially, the U235 isotope is enriched to 3 to 5% (from the natural state of 0.7%) and is then further processed to create nuclear fuel.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: India has consistently objected to higher levels of protection (TRIPs Plus) than provided by the TRIPs. The implication of TRIPs Plus on India is that it will restrict the operation of the countries’ generics drugs manufacturers. Similarly, it will prevent India firms from obtaining high technology at affordable prices. All these will lead to reduced exports from India.\nStatement 2 is not correct: TRIPs Plus are a higher level of protection norms demanded by the developed countries that are not prescribed by the WTO’s TRIPs regime. Although they are named as ‘TRIPS-Plus,’ they are not formally related to TRIPs. Rather, the term is used to indicate that these requirements go beyond the minimum standards imposed by TRIPs.\nStatement 3 is correct: An example for advanced norms under TRIPs Plus is the protection demanded by developed countries for data exclusivity. \nData exclusivity prevents drug regulators from referring to or relying on data submitted by an originator company relating to a drug’s safety and efficacy while approving bioequivalent versions of the same drug, i.e. therapeutically equivalent generics and biosimilars for a fixed period of time. A drug that comes to the market for the first time undergoes extensive preclinical and clinical trials on animals initially and human beings later before it is introduced for public use — a time-consuming and expensive process. Developed countries, on behalf of their pharmaceutical lobbies, seek data exclusivity in developing countries arguing that this is necessary to recognise and incentivise the efforts put in to bring a new drug to the market along with recovering the research and development costs incurred — arguments similar to those used to justify the grant of patents.\nTherefore option (a) is the correct answer.",

It was created by using “barnase/barstar” technology for genetic modification by adding genes from soil bacterium that makes mustard self-pollinating plants. It contains three genes viz. Bar gene, Barnase and Barstar are sourced from soil bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The bar gene has made plants resistant to herbicide. The Barnase gene confers male sterility, while the Barstar gene restores DMH - 11’s ability to produce fertile seeds.

For example, a stem cell cannot work with its neighbours to pump blood through the body (like a heart muscle cell). However, unspecialized stem cells can give rise to specialized cells, including heart muscle cells or nerve cells.\nStatement 2 is correct: Adult stem cells supply new cells as an organism grows and replace cells that get damaged.

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Animals face challenges in surviving in the desert environment. Most of animals behave as nocturnal, which means they sleep during the day in burrows or tunnels under the ground to stay cool and come out during night time, for example, gerbils, jerboa, and kangaroo rats.                                                                                    Statement 2 is incorrect: Desert conditions are marked by a long dry season with little precipitation. Plants and animals living in the desert need a special adaptation to survive in this harsh climate The key to survival in a hot, dry environment consists of avoiding climatic extremes as far as possible, by a combination of seeking refuge from the most adverse conditions, morphological adaptations, behaviour and specialized physiology. In the desert, physiological and morphological adaptations are elongated body shape, water-conserving capacity with vasopressin hormone, long legs, ears, thin skin and light skin colour.\nStatements 3 and 4 are correct: Excluding breeding season, respiration, urine, faeces and thermoregulatory processes such as sweating and evaporative cooling are the main physiological pathways for water loss in small rodents. Therefore, increasing urine concentration and reducing the volume of urine are important adaptations. Many lizards and some ground birds avoid overheating by running rapidly over the hot desert surface while maintaining their bodies well separated from the ground.\nTherefore option (b) is the correct answer.",

        "answer": "d",
        "explanation": "Plants in deserts adapt themselves to sustain the extreme environment of high temperatures and very low rainfall.\nA few of the adaptations that the desert plants go through are:\nRoot structure: Some plants have very deep tap roots to reach water deep below the surface.\nWaxy leaves: Leaves become small and waxy in order to minimize evaporation from the surface.\nNight blooming: Blooming during the daytime can lead to increased dehydration. Therefore, night blooming helps in saving water. Moreover, blooming at night also ensures better chances of pollination as most insects in the deserts are nocturnal.\nReproduction without seeds: Seeds require water to sprout, therefore, desert plants are adapted to reproduce without seeds.\nDrought resistance: Roots of desert plants are adapted to survive even after drying out.\nTherefore option (d) is the correct answer.",

As CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, decreasing the ocean’s pH. This is called ocean acidification. The acidity of the ocean has increased by 26% since the beginning of the industrial era.\nStatement 1 is correct: As the acidity of the ocean increases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere decreases. This decreases the ocean’s role in moderating climate change.\nStatement 2 is correct: The coral reef structure buffers shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, helping to prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion. When reefs are damaged or destroyed due to ocean acidification, the absence of this natural barrier can increase the damage to coastal communities from normal wave action and violent storms.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",

Natural eutrophication is a gradual process that takes place over a long period – even centuries. Although eutrophication happens naturally in water bodies, changes in land use and pollution due to human activity contribute to a much faster rate of eutrophication, called cultural eutrophication. Therefore, cultural eutrophication is not naturally occurring.\nStatement 2 is not correct: Cultural eutrophication increases nutrient levels in the lake causing algal bloom and increased productivity of the lake, leading to eutrophic lakes.

        "text": "With reference to Black Carbon, consider the following statements:\n 1. It is a long-lived pollutant produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.\n 2. It is the second-largest contributor to global warming only behind carbon dioxide.\n 3. It accelerates the pace of melting glaciers by increasing surface reflectance of sunlight.\n Which of the statements given above is/are not correct?\n (a) 1 and 2 only\n (b) 2 and 3 only\n (c) 1 and 3 only\n (d) 1, 2 and 3 only",
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is not correct but statement 2 is correct: Black Carbon is a short-lived pollutant that is the second-largest contributor to warming the planet after carbon dioxide (CO2). Unlike other greenhouse gas emissions, black carbon is quickly washed out and can be eliminated from the atmosphere if emissions stop.\nStatement 3 is not correct: A recent research covering the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush (HKHK) mountain ranges says glaciers are melting faster than the global average ice mass. The rate of retreat of HKHK glaciers is estimated to be 0.3 metres per year in the west to 1.0 metres per year in the east and black carbon adds to the impact of climate change. Deposits of black carbon act in two ways hastening the pace of glacier melt: by decreasing surface reflectance of sunlight and by raising air temperature.\nTherefore option (c) is the correct answer.",
