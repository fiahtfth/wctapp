# User Delete Feature - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview

Added the ability for admin users to delete users from the User Management interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Delete API Route
**File**: `src/app/api/users/delete/route.ts`

**Features**:
- âœ… Verifies admin authentication via JWT token
- âœ… Validates user ID before deletion
- âœ… Prevents admins from deleting themselves
- âœ… Checks if user exists before attempting deletion
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and logging
- âœ… Returns deleted user details in response

**Security Measures**:
- Admin-only access (403 Forbidden for non-admins)
- Token verification required
- Self-deletion prevention
- User existence validation

### 2. UI Updates
**File**: `src/app/(with-nav)/users/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

#### Added State Management
```typescript
const [openDeleteDialog, setOpenDeleteDialog] = useState(false);
const [userToDelete, setUserToDelete] = useState<User | null>(null);
```

#### Added Delete Button
- Red "Delete" button next to each user's "Edit" button
- Both buttons displayed in a flex container with gap
- Delete button uses error color scheme for visual warning

#### Added Confirmation Dialog
- Warning alert: "This action cannot be undone!"
- Displays user details:
  - Username
  - Email
  - Role
- Cancel and Delete User buttons
- Loading state during deletion

#### Added Delete Handler
```typescript
handleDeleteUser()
```
- Calls DELETE API endpoint
- Refreshes user list after successful deletion
- Shows error messages on failure
- Closes dialog after completion

## How to Use

### For Admin Users

1. **Navigate to User Management**
   - Go to `/users` page
   - Log in as admin if not already logged in

2. **Delete a User**
   - Click the red **"Delete"** button next to any user
   - A confirmation dialog will appear

3. **Confirm Deletion**
   - Review the user details shown
   - Click **"Delete User"** to confirm
   - Or click **"Cancel"** to abort

4. **Result**
   - User is removed from the database
   - User list refreshes automatically
   - Success is indicated by the user disappearing from the table

### Safety Features

1. **Cannot delete yourself**
   - Admins cannot delete their own account
   - API returns error: "You cannot delete your own account"

2. **Confirmation required**
   - Two-step process prevents accidental deletion
   - Warning message: "This action cannot be undone!"

3. **User details shown**
   - Review username, email, and role before deletion
   - Ensures you're deleting the correct user

## API Endpoint

### DELETE `/api/users/delete`

**Request Headers**:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "id": 123
}
```

**Success Response** (200):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User deleted successfully",
  "deletedUser": {
    "id": 123,
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "testuser@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid token
- **403 Forbidden**: Non-admin user attempted deletion
- **400 Bad Request**: Missing user ID or attempting self-deletion
- **404 Not Found**: User doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database error

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test successful deletion**:
   - Create a test user
   - Delete the test user
   - Verify user is removed from list
   - Verify user is deleted from database

2. **Test self-deletion prevention**:
   - Try to delete your own admin account
   - Should see error: "You cannot delete your own account"

3. **Test non-existent user**:
   - Try to delete a non-existent user ID
   - Should see error: "User not found"

4. **Test unauthorized access**:
   - Try to access API without admin token
   - Should see error: "Unauthorized" or "Only admins can delete users"

### Database Verification

After deleting a user, verify in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check if user was deleted
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = <deleted_user_id>;
-- Should return no rows

-- Check remaining users
SELECT id, username, email, role FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/app/api/users/delete/route.ts` (142 lines)
   - New DELETE endpoint

2. **Modified**: `src/app/(with-nav)/users/page.tsx`
   - Added delete dialog state
   - Added delete handler function
   - Added Delete button to table
   - Added confirmation dialog UI

## Security Considerations

- âœ… Admin-only access enforced
- âœ… JWT token verification required
- âœ… Self-deletion blocked
- âœ… User existence validated
- âœ… Comprehensive logging for audit trail
- âœ… No cascade delete issues (handles related records)

## UI/UX Features

- âœ… Clear visual warning (red button)
- âœ… Confirmation dialog with warning message
- âœ… User details displayed before deletion
- âœ… Loading state during operation
- âœ… Error messages displayed on failure
- âœ… Automatic list refresh after deletion
- âœ… Cancel option available at all times

## Complete Feature Set

The User Management interface now supports:
- âœ… View users (list with details)
- âœ… Create users (with username, email, password, role)
- âœ… Edit users (update all fields)
- âœ… Delete users (with confirmation)
- âœ… All operations update Supabase database in real-time

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Consider adding:
1. **Bulk delete**: Select multiple users and delete at once
2. **Soft delete**: Mark as inactive instead of hard delete
3. **Delete confirmation via email**: Send confirmation code
4. **Audit log**: Track who deleted which users and when
5. **Restore deleted users**: Keep deleted users in archive table
6. **Export user data**: Before deletion, allow exporting user data

The delete feature is **fully functional** and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
