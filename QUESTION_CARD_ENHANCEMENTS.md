# Question Card Enhancements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Question Card Display (`src/components/QuestionCard.tsx`)

#### Added Detailed Metadata Section
- **Subject**: Displays the question's subject area
- **Module**: Shows the module name
- **Topic**: Displays the topic
- **Sub-topic**: Shows the sub-topic
- **Question Type**: Displays whether it's Objective or Subjective
- **Difficulty Level**: Shows Easy/Medium/Hard with color coding
- **Nature of Question**: Additional classification if available

#### Improved Layout
- Added a metadata grid at the top of each card showing all question details
- Added visual divider between metadata and question content
- Added hover effect for better UX (shadow on hover)
- Improved chip styling for better visual hierarchy

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added error state display with Alert component
- Added success state display with confirmation message
- Improved button states (Adding.../Added!/Add to Cart)
- Auto-dismiss success message after 2 seconds
- Error messages can be manually dismissed

### 2. Fixed Add-to-Cart Functionality

#### Fixed Database Schema Issues
**Problem**: Code was trying to insert `is_draft` field which doesn't exist in the database schema

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/lib/server-actions.ts` (line 380-384)
- `src/lib/client-actions.ts` (lines 852-857 and 1167-1178)

**Changes**:
- Removed `is_draft: true` from cart creation in all locations
- Added comments explaining the removal
- This resolves the "Could not find the 'is_draft' column" error

#### Improved Error Propagation
**File**: `src/app/(with-nav)/questions/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced `handleAddToCart` function with detailed logging
- Added result validation to check for success
- Re-throw errors to allow QuestionCard to display them
- Added console logging for debugging

### 3. Usage History Feature

**Note**: The database schema doesn't currently have a downloads/usage history table. To implement this feature, you would need to:

1. Create a new migration file:
```sql
CREATE TABLE question_usage_history (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    question_id BIGINT REFERENCES questions(id),
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),
    action_type TEXT, -- 'download', 'added_to_cart', 'used_in_test'
    test_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_question_usage_question_id ON question_usage_history(question_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_question_usage_user_id ON question_usage_history(user_id);
```

2. Update the QuestionCard component to fetch and display usage stats
3. Track usage when questions are added to cart or downloaded

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Add-to-Cart**:
   - Navigate to `/questions`
   - Click "Add to Cart" on any question
   - Verify success message appears
   - Check cart count updates in navbar
   - Verify question appears in cart

2. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Test with network disconnected
   - Verify error messages display properly
   - Verify errors can be dismissed

3. **Test Metadata Display**:
   - Verify all question fields display correctly
   - Check that N/A appears for missing fields
   - Verify chips display with correct colors

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Lint Errors (Pre-existing)
The following lint errors exist in `server-actions.ts` but are pre-existing issues with the database type definitions:
- Missing type definitions for `users`, `carts`, `cart_items` tables
- Null checks for `supabase` client

These should be addressed separately by:
1. Updating the Supabase type generation
2. Adding proper null checks throughout the file
3. Regenerating types from the database schema

## Next Steps

1. **Add Usage Tracking**:
   - Create the usage history table
   - Implement tracking logic
   - Add usage stats to question cards

2. **Improve Type Safety**:
   - Regenerate Supabase types
   - Add proper null checks
   - Fix TypeScript errors

3. **Add More Metadata**:
   - Consider adding marks/points
   - Add tags display
   - Show faculty approval status
