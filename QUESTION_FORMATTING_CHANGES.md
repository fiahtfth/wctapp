# Question Formatting Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to implement proper question formatting in the WCT app. The implementation supports multiple question formats commonly used in educational assessments.

## Supported Question Formats

### 1. "With reference to X, consider the following statements:" Format

**Structure:**
```
With reference to [Topic], consider the following statements:

1. [Statement 1]
2. [Statement 2]
3. [Statement 3]

How many of the above given statements is/are correct?
(a) [Option A]
(b) [Option B]
(c) [Option C]
(d) [Option D]
```

**Example:**
```
With reference to Tertiary activities, consider the following statements:

1. Tertiary activities involve the commercial output of services rather than the production of tangible goods.
2. In the initial stages of economic development, larger proportion of people worked in the tertiary sector.
3. Tertiary activities are directly involved in the processing of physical raw materials.

How many of the above given statements is/are correct?
(a) Only One
(b) Only Two
(c) All Three
(d) None
```

### 2. "Consider the following statements:" Format

**Structure:**
```
Consider the following statements:

1. [Statement 1]
2. [Statement 2]

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) [Option A]
(b) [Option B]
(c) [Option C]
(d) [Option D]
```

**Example:**
```
Consider the following statements:

1. Commodities like medicines usually have unitary elastic demand.
2. Commodities like Air Conditioners usually have high elastic demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
```

### 3. "Which of the following..." Format

**Structure:**
```
[Question text]?
(a) [Option A]
(b) [Option B]
(c) [Option C]
(d) [Option D]
```

**Example:**
```
Which of the following monetary policy actions can play a role in improving a situation of low demand?
(a) Boosting aggregate demand by printing more currency notes.
(b) Increasing liquidity in the market by selling bonds to the public.
(c) Both (a) and (b)
(d) None of the above
```

### 4. Simple Multiple Choice Format

**Structure:**
```
[Question text]
(a) [Option A]
(b) [Option B]
(c) [Option C]
(d) [Option D]
```

**Example:**
```
A commodity with few or no substitutes is likely to have
(a) Highly elastic demand
(b) Elastic demand
(c) Less price elasticity
(d) High cross elasticity
```

## Implementation Details

### Parsing Logic
The parsing logic is implemented in the `FixedQuestionCard` component and handles:

1. **Format Detection:** Identifies which format a question follows by looking for specific keywords and patterns
2. **Statement Extraction:** Extracts numbered statements (1., 2., 3., etc.) from the question text
3. **Option Extraction:** Extracts multiple choice options in various formats ((a), a), etc.)
4. **Special Cases:** Handles edge cases like missing options or unusual formatting

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Option Formatting:** Supports both (a) and a) formats for options
2. **Robust Error Handling:** Falls back to default display for unrecognized formats
3. **Type Safety:** Uses TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains support for existing question formats

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/FixedQuestionCard.tsx` - Main implementation with improved parsing logic
2. `src/components/QuestionList.tsx` - Updated to use FixedQuestionCard
3. `scripts/seed-questions.js` - Updated to include sample questions in all formats
4. `scripts/test-parsing.js` - Test script to verify parsing logic
5. `scripts/verify-parsing.js` - Verification script for production testing

## Testing Results

Testing with 10 sample questions from the database showed:

- 1 question in "With reference to" format
- 3 questions in "Consider the following statements" format
- 5 questions in "Which of the following" format
- 1 question in default format (fallback)

All questions are parsed and displayed correctly according to their respective formats.

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Missing Options:** Special handling for Question ID 12 which was missing the "d) None of the above" option
2. **Unusual Formatting:** Question ID 20 with a unique structure falls back to default display
3. **Mixed Formats:** Questions with combinations of different formatting patterns
4. **Empty/Invalid Text:** Proper handling of empty or invalid question text

## Future Improvements

1. **Database Schema Update:** Consider storing statements and options separately in the database for better performance
2. **Enhanced Parsing:** Add support for additional question formats as needed
3. **Performance Optimization:** Implement caching for parsed questions to improve rendering speed
4. **Internationalization:** Add support for different languages and regional formatting variations
