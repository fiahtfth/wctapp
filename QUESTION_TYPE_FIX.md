# Question Type Filter Fix ✅

## Problem

The Question Type dropdown was showing **10 different question types**:
- Objective
- Subjective
- Multiple Choice
- Short Answer
- Long Answer
- Case Study
- Numerical
- Theoretical
- Conceptual
- Applied

**Requirement**: Only **2 types** should be available: **Objective** and **Subjective**

## Solution

**File**: `src/components/QuestionFilter.tsx`

### Before (Lines 43-54):
```typescript
const QUESTION_TYPES = [
  'Objective',
  'Subjective',
  'Multiple Choice',
  'Short Answer',
  'Long Answer',
  'Case Study',
  'Numerical',
  'Theoretical',
  'Conceptual',
  'Applied'
];
```

### After (Lines 43-46):
```typescript
const QUESTION_TYPES = [
  'Objective',
  'Subjective'
];
```

## Changes Made

1. **Removed 8 unnecessary question types**:
   - ❌ Multiple Choice
   - ❌ Short Answer
   - ❌ Long Answer
   - ❌ Case Study
   - ❌ Numerical
   - ❌ Theoretical
   - ❌ Conceptual
   - ❌ Applied

2. **Kept only the required 2 types**:
   - ✅ Objective
   - ✅ Subjective

## Impact

- **Simpler UI**: Cleaner dropdown with only 2 options
- **Better UX**: Users won't be confused by unnecessary options
- **Consistent**: Matches the actual question categorization system
- **Faster filtering**: Fewer options to choose from

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to `/questions` page
2. Open the **Question Type** dropdown
3. ✅ Should see only 3 options:
   - "All Types" (default)
   - "Objective"
   - "Subjective"

### Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**:
```
Question Type Dropdown:
- All Types
- Objective
- Subjective
- Multiple Choice      ❌
- Short Answer         ❌
- Long Answer          ❌
- Case Study           ❌
- Numerical            ❌
- Theoretical          ❌
- Conceptual           ❌
- Applied              ❌
```

**After Fix**:
```
Question Type Dropdown:
- All Types
- Objective            ✅
- Subjective           ✅
```

## Database Alignment

This change aligns with the database schema where `question_type` column stores only:
- `Objective`
- `Subjective`

Any questions with other types in the database should be normalized to one of these two categories.

## Related Components

- **QuestionFilter.tsx** - Filter component (fixed)
- **queries.ts** - Query builder (no changes needed)
- **Question type** - Already defined as `'Objective' | 'Subjective'` in types

## Status: FIXED ✅

The Question Type filter now shows only the two required categories: **Objective** and **Subjective**.
